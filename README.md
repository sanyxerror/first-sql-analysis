# E-Commerce Shipping Analysis â€“ SQL
This project explores a Kaggle dataset related to e-commerce shipping and product returns. My main goal was to improve my SQL skills through hands-on querying and to start building confidence in working with real-world datasets.

## Objective
- Analyze a structured dataset from Kaggle using PostgreSQL.
- Strengthen foundational SQL skills through practical question-building.
- Understand real-world logistics patterns like shipping modes, return behavior, and discount effectiveness.
- Practice thinking analytically and presenting findings clearly.

> This was my first solo data project â€” with a little help from AI when needed â€” and it helped me overcome the initial fear of working with raw data.


## Tools Used
- **SQL Engine**: PostgreSQL (hosted on DataCamp Datalab)
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle â€“ E-Commerce Shipping Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics)
- **Visualization**: Power BI (coming soon)
- **Support**: ChatGPT (for brainstorming + syntax help)


## Key Questions Answered
1. Total orders overall
2. Most-used shipment modes
3. Avg. discount by shipment mode
4. Warehouse block shipping volume
5. Return patterns vs. customer care calls
6. Rating differences in returned vs. non-returned products
7. Gender differences in returns
8. Repeat vs. first-time customer behavior
9. Product importance & return rates
10. Product weight & returns
11. Discount level vs. returns
12. Shipment mode rank by warehouse
13. Warehouse x importance return combos
14. Product weight category return rates

## Key Learnings
- Confidence in building SQL queries from scratch.
- Translating business-style problems into SQL logic.
- Reminder: **just start** â€” clean data is great, but trying to find insights from it was ðŸ”¥ for my thinking.
- Cloud-based tools like Datalab saved me from setup headaches.
- Used ChatGPT as a support tool â€” but understood every line before using it.


## Challenges
- PostgreSQL local setup (VS Code, Jupyter...) was a mess â€” switched to Datalab.
- Writing business-oriented questions was overwhelming at first, but chunking helped.
- Havenâ€™t figured out Power BI + SQL integration yet (goals for future me).


## Next Steps
- Finish and upload Power BI dashboard version.
- Replicate with Python (Pandas + Seaborn).
- Try SQL in local setup once I'm comfy.
- Work on projects involving JOINs and subqueries next time!
